//AIM:  Create a class Employee having instance variable name, address, age and salary. Demonstrate use of copy constructor.

//CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;
class Employee{
String name,address;
int age,salary;
//parameterized constructor 
Employee(String n,String add, int a,int s){
		name=n;
		address=add;
		age=a;
		salary=s;
	}
//copy constructor 
Employee(Employee e){
		name = e.name;
		address = e.address;
		age = e.age;
		salary = e.salary;
	}
}
	public class p15{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		
		String name,address;
		int age,salary;
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("\nEnter employee's name: ");
		name = in.nextLine();
		System.out.print("\nEnter employee's address: ");
		address = in.nextLine();
		Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("\nEnter employee's age: ");
		age = read.nextInt();
		System.out.print("\nEnter employee's salary: ");
		salary = read.nextInt();

		emp e = new emp(name,address,age,salary);
		System.out.println("\n---Employee's details---\n");
		System.out.println("Name: "+e.name+"\nAddress: "+e.address+"\nAge: "+e.age+"\nSalary: "+e.salary);

		//copy constructor
		System.out.println("\n---Employee's details in copy constructor---\n");
		emp e1 = new emp(e);
		System.out.println(e1.name);
		System.out.println("Name: "+e1.name+"\nAddress: "+e1.address+"\nAge: "+e1.age+"\nSalary: "+e1.salary);
		
	}
}
